As a first goal, conda attempts to choose the latest version of foo-lib. However, maybe foo-lib depends on bar-lib, which itself is available in various versions (say 1 through 20 in its versioning scheme). It might be that foo-lib 3.1 is compatible with bar-lib versions 17, 18, and 19; but blob-lib (which is already installed) is compatible only with versions of bar-lib less than 17. Therefore, conda would examine the compatibility of foo-lib 3.0 as a fallback. In this hypothetical, foo-lib 3.0 is compatible with bar-lib 16, so that version is chosen (bar-lib is also updated to the latest compatible version 16 in the same command if an earlier version is currently installed)."
